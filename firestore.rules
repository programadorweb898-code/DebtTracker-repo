/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and debtors.
 * All data is nested under /users/{userId} and /debtors/{debtorId}, with access controlled by the authenticated user's UID.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information (email, UID, creation date).
 * - /debtors/{debtorId}: Stores debtor information, each containing an array of their debt records.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only create, read, update, and delete their own profile data.
 * - Users can only create, read, update, and delete their own debtors.
 * - Listing of all users is disallowed for privacy.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Debtors contain an `ownerUid` field, which is used to verify ownership.
